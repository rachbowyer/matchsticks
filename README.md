# Matchsticks


This is the first Windows application that I ever wrote. For the full story click [here](https://www.bowyer.info/post/the-first-ever-windows-app-that-i-wrote)


## How to play

Matchsticks is a version of [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim). It is a 16 bit Windows application designed for Windows 3.1. It might run on later versions of Windows that support 16 bit applications.


Use the mouse to select the matches you wish to remove and click the selected area to play your move. 



## How to build

It needs Turbo C++ for Windows 3.1 (or presumably Borland C++ 3.1) running on Windows 3.1. As it is an OWL 1.0 application, I don't think it can be built using the later versions of the Borland C++ compilers.
